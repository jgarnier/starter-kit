## Tools

In this section aims to give all informations on the useful tools you might consider once starting your project, from project management to documentation.

## Project Management

Before starting anything, could be good to really setup a project management space in order to make sure that you've got a simple TODO list for you or a project space if you're working as a team and would like to be organised in term of tasks management.

- The first tool, which is free to use is [Trello](https://trello.com/). With this tool which is really simple and easy to use, you can really manage just a simple TODO list or a project in Agile mode. See [here](./project_management/trello.md) for more information about Trello.

- For people who are really used to project management, they are more familiar with [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). This is really a powerful tool with plenty of nice features. There is a free option for non-profit. See [here](./project_management/jira.md) for more information about Trello.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) could also be used for managing project. See [here](./scm/github.md#Managing%20project) for more information about GitHub.

## Source Code Management

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software. This is a well known tool for managing your source code. See [here](./scm/github.md) for more information about GitHub.

- [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) is more than just Git code management. Bitbucket gives teams one place to plan projects, collaborate on code, test, and deploy.


## Documentation

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) could also be used for managing your documentation. See [here](./scm/github.md#Creating%20documentation) for more information about GitHub.
- [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) is also a well known tool for creating documentation. I use it a lot and this is also done in this current project. See [here](./documentation/gitbook.md) for more information about Gitbook. Keep in mind that your documentation is really key for yourself, your users and everyone in your ecosystem.

## Platform

Given you need to have some visibility, this section aims to give all informations on the platfoms available for hosting your services.

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. See [here](./platform/heroku.md) for more information about Heroku.

- [Amazon Web Services ](https://aws.amazon.com/) offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services. Free to join, pay only for what you use. See [here](./platform/aws.md) for more information about AWS.

## Websites

This section will give details on the websites part.

- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/): A nonprofit Certificate Authority providing TLS certificates to 190 million websites. See [here](./web/letsencrypt.md) for more information about Let's Encrypt.
